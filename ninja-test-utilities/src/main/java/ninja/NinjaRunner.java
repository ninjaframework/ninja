/**
 * <p>
 * NinjaRunner makes it easy to test DAOs and service objects.
 * Service objects are generally the place where business logic executed.
 * Each service object may be injected a lot of DAOs.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Suppose you have some service objects ,
 * without NinjaRunner , the only way to test service objects is to getInstance() of these DAOs
 * from Guice's injector and manually constructor-injecting to the service object
 * in NinjaTest's {@code @Before} method.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * With NinjaRunner , you just add {@code @RunWith(NinjaRunner.class)} to your test class ,
 * and declare {@code @Inject private ServiceObj serviceObj;} and you'll get an
 * injected serviceObj. No more {@code @Before} methods.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 *     Code Example :
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * {@code &#064;RunWith(NinjaRunner.class)
 *   public class DataServiceTest  {
 *     &#064;Inject private ServiceObj serviceObj;
 *
 *     &#064;Test
 *     public void testDataService() {
 *       assert (serviceObj != null);
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
