<title>Injection Example Controller</title>
<body>
<h1>Welcome to the injection controller!</h1>
<p>The injected method just said: <b>${greeting}</b></p>
<p>Doesn't sound cool? Well. Ok - true. But it demonstrates that
injection on controllers is working fine. And that in turn is really
cool if you want to get maintainable applications with injected services :)
