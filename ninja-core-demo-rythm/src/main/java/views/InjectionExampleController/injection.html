@args String greeting

<title>Injection Example Controller</title>
<body>
	<h1>Welcome to the injection controller!</h1>
	<p>
		The injected method just said: <b>@greeting</b>
	</p>
	<p>Doesn't sound cool? Well. Ok - true. But it demonstrates that
		injection on controllers is working fine. And that in turn is really
		cool if you want to get maintainable applications with injected
		services :)</p>
