/**
 * This interface means the validation context (implemented by {@link ValidationImpl}) and can be injected in your
 * controller method.
 * There are several types of violations that can occur: field violations (on controller method fields), bean violations
 * (on an injected beans field) or general violations (deprecated). A controller using this validation can have
 * violations on his
 * parameters or, if you use a injected data container like a DTO or bean, you may have violations inside this object.
 * Each violation on a field (parameter or in an annotated bean) results in a {@link FieldViolation}. This makes it
 * possible to validate all controller parameters at once. If an error appears while validating the controller
 * method parameters, it results in a violation which you can get using getFieldViolations().
 * If your injected bean contains violations, you should use getBeanViolations().
