/**
 * This annotation is the equivalent to @Transactional without transactions.
 * 
 * IMPORTANT:
 * Not using @UnitOfWork or @Transactional when accessing your database is 
 * not recommended. If you do so you might end up with a lot of open connections.
 * 
 * The difference between @Transactional and @UnitOfWork is that @UnitOfWork
 * does not open or commit any transactions. This may be faster for simple reads. 
 * But if you alter data you should use @Transactional.
 * 
 * You can use UnitOfWork simultaneously on many levels (methods, classes etc).
 * But only the most outer declaration will open a unit of work. There us no
 * nesting of unit of works taking place.
 * 
 * You can mix @UnitOfWork and @Transactional. UnitOfWork will keep the unit open,
 * and all levels annotated with @Transactional will open and commit transactions.
