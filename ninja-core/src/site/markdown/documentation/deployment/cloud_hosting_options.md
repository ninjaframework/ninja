Cloud Hosting options
=====================

Introduction
------------

Hosting a Ninja application is pretty straight forward. At a very basic level you
only need a Java runtime environment - then you can use Ninja's standalone
mode and you are done.

But sometimes you don't want to host the application yourself and therefore we
have compiled a list of cloud hosting providers that support Ninja.

Google App Engine
-----------------

[Google's App Engine] (https://developers.google.com/appengine/) is a great hosting service provided by Google.
The really cool feature is that it scales automatically. 
Deploy and never worry about any scaling issues - that's the basic promise of the App Engine.

Ninja is fully compatible to the App Engine via the ninja-appengine module.

Please follow the guide at: https://github.com/ninjaframework/ninja-appengine/


Heroku support
--------------

Ninja is fully supported by Heroku. Check out the blog post at:
