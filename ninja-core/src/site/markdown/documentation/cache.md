Cache
=====

Ninja supports Memcached (http://www.danga.com/memcached/) as primary caching layer. 
In standalone mode Ninja uses EhCache (http://ehcache.org/) as default implementation.

<b>When using a cache you MUST expect that your cache will fail.</b>

In production on multiple machines always use Memcached. On a single machine and when developing 
your application it is fine using EhCache. 
If you are running EhCache on a cluster with multiple machines - your machines will have a state what 
is not compatible with the way Ninja works.


First steps
===========

Using Ninja's caching facilities is straight forward. You inject NinjaCache into the classes that
want to use caching and you are ready to go.

<pre class="prettyprint">    
    @Inject NinjaCache ninjaCache;

    public Result allPosts() {
    
        List<Post> posts = ninjaCache.get("posts", List.class);
        if(products == null) {
            posts = postDao.findAll();
            ninjaCache.set("posts", posts, "30mn");
        }
        
        return Results.html().render(posts);
        
    }
</pre>

NinjaCache provides a range of methods to store, retrieve and manipulate data in your cache.
Some methods have a duplicate "safe" method (eg. ninjaCache.safeDelete(...) vs. ninjaCache.delete(...)).

The difference is that methods prefixed with "safe" issue a blocking call waiting for the call to be successful, 
while note prefixed methods issue a fire and forget call that does not guarantee 
that call succeeds. Always prefer non-prefixed methods as they do not block your application.


Configuring Memcached
=====================

To use Memcached you have to add the following configuration variables to your application.conf file:

<pre class="prettyprint">
    cache.implementation=ninja.cache.CacheMemcachedImpl

    memcached.host=127.0.0.1:11211
    
    // user and password are optional
    memcached.user=USER          
    memcached.password=PASSWORD        
</pre>

When you are using multiple memcached instances you can specify them via:

<pre class="prettyprint">
    memcached.host=127.0.0.1:11211 127.0.0.1:11212 127.0.0.1:11213
</pre>


As usual you can prefix your variables to use memcached in production and ehcache while developing
and testing:

<pre class="prettyprint">

    %prod.cache.implementation=ninja.cache.CacheMemcachedImpl
    
</pre>
