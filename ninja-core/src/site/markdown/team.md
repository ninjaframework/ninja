The team - a.k.a the Ninjas

Hall of fame

Ninja is standing on the shoulder of giants.

Technical lead
--------------

Someone has to be in charge of integrating pull requests. Reviewing code. Cutting
new releases. And driving the platform as a whole.

That leadership role is currently performed by the team of [FinalFrontierLabs](http://www.finalfrontierlabs.com) 
and [Raphael](http://raphaelbauer.com) as lead architect. 

If you want to take over a more official role in the Ninja platform don't hesitate
to contact us! The framework offers excellent
opportunities to collaborate with nice people and drive an extraordinary project.


Become part of the team!
------------------------

Ninja is open source and driven by enthusiasts. We love what we
do and we have a long term goal: Ensuring that Ninja is the best web framework
written in Java.

Community contributions are at the core of the Ninja framework.
These contributions are not only new features,
but also documentation and bug reports. Every bit is a step 
forward ensuring our success.

We have a really good track record of integrating community pull requests.
Looking forward seeing you on the mailing list. Let's talk about your ideas
 - we are social creatures!
