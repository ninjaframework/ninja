The Ninjas
==========

Introduction
------------
Ninja is open source. Everybody is invited to contribute. And that is not
limited to code alone. Reporting issues is really important. Documentation 
is very very important. 

And if you don't like what you see - feel free to fork Ninja or implement a new feature. 
Looking forward seeing you on the mailing list - we are social creatures :)


Hall of fame
------------

Ninja was initiated by [Raphael Bauer](http://raphaelbauer.com). But Ninja is standing on the should of giants. 
We are using an immense amount of libraries and ideas from open source projects.
Especially ideas from Rails, Play 1 and Play 2 and also libraries from Google, Apache and Sun/Oracle. 
This is the time to say **Thank you**. We hope we can contribute a bit back to the world.

Over the time a lot of awesome people have
contributed stuff to Ninja. In some random order:

 * James Roper
 * Henning Schuetz
 * Marco Reinwarth
 * Philip Sommer
 * Liu Lujie

Do you feel you are missing from that list? Please let us know - this did not happen
intentionally. You can even add yourself to the list:
You can do so easily by checking out the source code of Ninja and changing the file
