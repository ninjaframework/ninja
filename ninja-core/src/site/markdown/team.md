The Ninjas
==========

Introduction
------------
Ninja is open source. Everybody is invited to contribute. And that is not
limited to code alone. Reporting issues is really important. Documentation 
is also mega-important. And if you don't like what you see - feel free to fork Ninja. 
Or implement a new feature. Discuss stuff on our mailing list. We are social creatures :)

Official sponsor: FinalFrontierLabs
-----------------------------------
The main sponsor of the Ninja Web Framework are the FinalFrontierLabs 
Berlin http://finalfrontierlabs.com. FFL also provides professional support
and application development.

But most importantly FFL is taking care that the project is maintained and in a 
ready to use state.
