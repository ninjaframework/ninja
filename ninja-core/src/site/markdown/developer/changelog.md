Version 2.4.0
=============

* 2013-12-02 Session/cookie sharing between subdomains. (linx56)
* 2013-12-05 Fix + test in maven plugin. Assets directory was not ignored / regex wrong. (ra)
* 2013-12-05 Fixed wrong hamcrest imports (junit imports hamcrest 1.3, mockito by default imports hamcrest 1.1).
             JUnit now always above mockito in pom.xml - therefore hamcrest 1.3 takes precedence over hamcrest 1.1 (ra)
* 2013-12-13 Bugfix in session implementation. Authenticity token and ID not sent under some circumstances. (ra)
* 2013-12-13 Ninja now uses "ninja.mode=prod" by default (and no longer dev). 
             Many users complained that it is quite strange to configure the prod 
             mode when running Ninja as war inside a  servlet container.  These problems
             are now gone. (ra)
* 2013-12-14 Json Jackson mapper now uses Afterburner by default for reading / writing
             Json Pojos (Also valid for rendering JsonP). This should improve Json performance
             a lot. (ra)
* 2013-12-14 Fixed a performance bug where output streams / outputwriters were not properly
             closed. This affected the performance of rendering raw Strings and
             raw byte arrays. (ra)

             Test classes. (ra)

* 2013-12-14 Fixed getInjector() behavior of NinjaServletListener. Multiple calling
             of getInjector() caused the generation of multiple Ninja instances what
             is wrong. (ra)
* 2013-12-14 Streamlined test-utilities. Now all Ninja*Tests start a new Ninja server
             before each test. (NinjaDocTester for instance started Ninja before each
             class. That was inconsistent) (ra).
* 2013-12-14 Bump to org.doctester 1.1.1 and fluentlenium 0.9.1 (ra).
* 2013-12-15 Fixed bug in result.renderRaw(). Used outputStream to render strings, 
             will lead to problems with utf-8 characters.

             those files as translateable and provide i18n editors. (amsz, ra)
* 2013-11-29 Fixed potential bug in i18n module. Locale was not set when parsing
             locale sensitive special MessageFormat patterns like {0, date} (ra)
