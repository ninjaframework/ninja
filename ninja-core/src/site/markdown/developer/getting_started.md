Code style
----------

- Default Sun Java / Eclipse code style (a default config for eclipse can be found at the project root eclipse-ninja-format.xml.
- If you change only tiny things only reformat stuff you actually changed. Otherwise reviewing is really hard.
- We use spaces / 4 spaces as a tab in all files (java, xml...).
- All files are UTF-8.
