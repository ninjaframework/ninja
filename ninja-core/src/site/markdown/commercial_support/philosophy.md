Our philosophy
==============

Ninja is open source and will be open source forever
----------------------------------------------------

The Ninja team is made up of open source enthusiasts. We really
think that open source leads to better software and better value for users and
businesses. We love to collaborate and share our code with the world.

Ninja is distributed under the Apache 2 license. 
This makes sure that Ninja will be open source forever.


To back up your business we offer commercial grade support
----------------------------------------------------------

On the other hand - many of us are involved in companies that use 
Ninja on a daily basis. Ninja is a key component to deliver business value.
Therefore we know that choosing a technology is a long term investment. We are here
to guarantee success for that investment.

For instance Ninja's Apache 2 license is known as one of the most business friendly licenses.

And we also offer excellent support in three areas:
Training, support packages and custom development.
