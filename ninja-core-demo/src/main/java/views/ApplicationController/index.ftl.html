		<h2>Fun and Productive</h2>
		<p>Cut out the time you spend waiting for your application to
			restart, increase your productivity and complete your projects
			faster.</p>

		<h2>CoC!</h2>
		<p>That means convention over configuration! We designed Ninja to
			be usable in 99% of the cases without any additional configuration.
			That speeds up development right from the start. And for the last 1%
			you can of course configure everything yourself. Just in case...</p>

		<h2>Java only</h2>

		<h2>Powerful build system</h2>
		<p>Maven is one of the best build and library management systems out there. And
			Ninja is built for it. Even better: Automating your builds in Jenkins
			becomes as easy as specifying the pom.</p>

		<h2>Ready to start</h2>
		<p>Download the package and you're done. Start hacking with the
			integrated development server. Push to production with a single
			command.</p>

		<h2>Servlets galore!</h2>
		<p>Servlet containers are the standard in the Java world. Ninja works
		out of the box with all popular servlet containers. Therefore you get both:
		Standard compliance and ultra-fast development cycles.</p>
